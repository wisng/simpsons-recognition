# Simpsons Characters Identification

This repository contains code for identifying Simpsons characters using a neural network model. The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from Kaggle's "The Simpsons Characters Dataset" available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset).

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of various Simpsons characters. Each image is labeled with the corresponding character's name. It includes a diverse range of characters from the Simpsons universe.

## Neural Network Model
The identification task is approached using a neural network implemented using Keras' Sequential API. The model architecture includes convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and dense layers for classification. The model is trained on the provided dataset to learn the patterns and features associated with each character.

## Performance
After training the model on the dataset, it achieved an accuracy of approximately 56% on the test set. While this accuracy may not be exceptionally high, it demonstrates the model's ability to recognize Simpsons characters to a certain extent. Further improvements to the model architecture, data preprocessing, and training parameters could potentially enhance its performance.
